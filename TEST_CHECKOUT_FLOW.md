# Wallet-Based Checkout Flow Test

## Current Status
- Stripe has been disabled and all payments now use the wallet system
- The checkout button redirects to `Customer/Checkout` instead of `Stripe/CreateCheckoutSession`

## Test Steps for Wallet Checkout

### 1. Add Items to Cart
- Browse to any product page
- Click "Add to Cart" button
- Verify cart shows items

### 2. Verify Cart Contents
- Navigate to `/Cart`
- Ensure cart displays items correctly
- Check that cart total is calculated

### 3. Test Checkout Flow
- Click "Proceed to Checkout" button
- Should redirect to `/Customer/Checkout`
- Should NOT redirect to `/Browse` page

### 4. Wallet Requirements
- User must have sufficient wallet balance
- If balance is insufficient, should show "Insufficient wallet balance" message
- If balance is sufficient, should show "Place Order" button

### 5. Order Placement
- Enter delivery address
- Click "Place Order" button
- **Expected**: Success message and redirect to Home page (with cart cleared)
- **Fixed**: Should now show success message properly and cart should be cleared

### Expected Behavior After Fix
- **Successful Order**: Shows success message on Home page, cart is cleared
- **Failed Order**: Shows specific error message on checkout page (insufficient balance, stock issues, etc.)

## Known Issues Fixed
✅ **Cart Empty Issue**: Fixed `CustomerController.Checkout()` to use database cart instead of session cart
✅ **Cart Integration**: Updated `PlaceOrder` method to use database cart
✅ **Stripe Disabled**: All Stripe-related functionality has been disabled

## Expected Behavior
1. Customer adds items to cart
2. Customer clicks checkout button
3. Customer sees checkout page with order summary
4. Customer enters delivery information
5. Customer places order using wallet balance
6. Order is created and wallet is charged

## Configuration
- `StripeEnabled` is set to `false` in Web.config
- All payments processed through wallet system
- No Stripe API calls are made
