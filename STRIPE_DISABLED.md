# Stripe Payment Integration - Disabled

## Overview
Stripe payment integration has been disabled in this application. The system now exclusively uses the built-in wallet-based payment system for all transactions.

## Changes Made to Disable Stripe

### 1. Configuration Setting
Added a new configuration setting in `Web.config`:
```xml
<add key="StripeEnabled" value="false" />
```

### 2. Cart Checkout Button
Updated `Views/Cart/Index.cshtml`:
- Changed the checkout button from `CreateCheckoutSession` (Stripe) to `Checkout` (Customer controller)
- Users are now redirected to the wallet-based checkout system

### 3. Global Stripe Initialization Disabled
Modified `Global.asax.cs`:
- Commented out the Stripe API key initialization
- Added logging to indicate Stripe is disabled

### 4. Stripe Controller Protection
Updated `Controllers/StripeController.cs`:
- Added configuration check in `CreateCheckoutSession()` method
- If Stripe is disabled, users are redirected to wallet-based checkout with an informative message

### 5. Stripe Views Updated
Modified `Views/Stripe/Index.cshtml`:
- Added conditional logic to show disabled message when Stripe is disabled
- Provides a direct link to wallet-based checkout
- Only shows Stripe payment options when explicitly enabled

## Current Payment Flow

### Wallet-Based Checkout Process:
1. **Cart Page**: Users click "Proceed to Checkout" button
2. **Customer Checkout**: Redirected to `Customer/Checkout` action
3. **Order Placement**: Users enter delivery address and notes
4. **Wallet Payment**: System checks wallet balance
5. **Order Completion**: If sufficient balance, order is placed and wallet is debited

### Wallet Management:
- Users can add funds to their wallet through various methods
- Wallet balance is checked before order placement
- Transaction history is maintained for all wallet operations

## How to Re-enable Stripe (If Needed)

### Option 1: Enable via Configuration
1. Set `StripeEnabled` to `true` in `Web.config`:
   ```xml
   <add key="StripeEnabled" value="true" />
   ```
2. Uncomment Stripe initialization in `Global.asax.cs`
3. Ensure valid Stripe API keys are configured

### Option 2: Remove Stripe Completely
1. Remove Stripe package reference from `packages.config`
2. Delete `StripeController.cs` and related views
3. Remove Stripe configuration from `Web.config`
4. Remove Stripe initialization from `Global.asax.cs`

## Security Considerations

### With Stripe Disabled:
- ✅ No external payment API calls
- ✅ Reduced attack surface
- ✅ Simplified payment flow
- ✅ No PCI compliance requirements for card processing

### Wallet System Security:
- Internal transaction processing
- User balance validation
- Transaction logging and auditing
- No external dependencies for payments

## Testing Without Stripe

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Add items to cart** and proceed to checkout
2. **Verify wallet balance** is checked correctly
3. **Test insufficient balance** handling
4. **Confirm order placement** with sufficient balance
5. **Check transaction history** is properly recorded

### Expected Behavior:
- No Stripe API calls are made
- All payments processed through wallet system
- Users see wallet-based checkout options only
- Appropriate error messages for disabled features

## Support

If you need to:
- **Re-enable Stripe**: Follow the re-enable steps above
- **Troubleshoot wallet payments**: Check wallet balance and transaction logs
- **Add alternative payment methods**: Consider integrating other payment providers
- **Modify payment flow**: Update `CustomerController.Checkout` and related views

## Files Modified

- `Web.config` - Added StripeEnabled setting
- `Global.asax.cs` - Disabled Stripe initialization
- `Controllers/StripeController.cs` - Added disable checks
- `Views/Cart/Index.cshtml` - Updated checkout button
- `Views/Stripe/Index.cshtml` - Added disabled message

The application now operates exclusively with the wallet-based payment system, providing a simpler and more controlled payment environment.
